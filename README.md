👋🏽😄 Hello! 

I'm Danielle, and I'm breaking into tech! 👩🏽‍💻🌟
In 2021, I was working in the human services field and decided to take a leap of faith and get into tech! I left my employer and started a 3 week beginner's course. Shortly after finishing, I went onto learn with DevCodeCamp and obtained a Software Development certification 🤓. I'm still learning daily, feel free to check out some projects & stay tuned for new ones 😎 I am currently working at improving my development skills with a new project that is a weather app! 

A few random {but fun} facts!:
  1. I looooove music {especially opera and/or classical while coding}
  2. I love HTML, Javascript, CSS and React!
  3. Eventually, I would love to open a non-profit that teachers inner city kids from my hometown to code!
